## ‚ú® Features

Hand Dance is an interactive psychedelic art generator that transforms hand movements into mesmerizing visual effects using real-time computer vision. Simply show your hands to the camera and watch as your fingertips create stunning particle animations.

### Visual Effects
- **Kaleidoscope** - 4-way symmetrical patterns that mirror your movements
- **Spiral Galaxy** - Swirling cosmic patterns following your hands
- **Fireworks** - Explosive bursts emanating from fingertips
- **Liquid Flow** - Fluid, flowing particles with physics simulation
- **Mandala** - 8-way sacred geometry patterns
- **Aurora** - Northern lights effect with ethereal trails
- **Plasma Storm** - Electric energy fields and lightning effects
- **Water Waves** - Ripple waves expanding from fingertips

### Interactive Controls
- **Opacity Control** - Adjust transparency of effects and camera overlay
- **Rotation Speed** - Control particle rotation and swirl intensity
- **Animation Speed** - Modify particle movement velocity
- **Particle Density** - Adjust the number of particles generated
- **Camera Toggle** - Show/hide camera feed behind effects
- **Landmarks Toggle** - Display hand tracking points for debugging
- **Fullscreen Mode** - Immersive full-screen experience
- **FPS Monitor** - Real-time performance indicator

### Technical Features
- Real-time hand tracking using MediaPipe
- Supports up to 2 hands simultaneously
- Mobile-responsive design with touch controls
- Optimized performance for smooth 60fps rendering
- Advanced particle systems with physics simulation
- Multiple blend modes for different visual effects
- Adaptive quality based on device capabilities

## üöÄ Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- Modern web browser with camera support
- Camera permissions enabled
- Stable internet connection (for MediaPipe CDN)

### Installation

1. **Download or Clone**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/hand-dance.git
   cd hand-dance
   ```

2. **Serve the Files**
   
   Since the app uses MediaPipe from CDN, you can simply open `index.html` in your browser, or serve it using any web server:
   
   ```bash
   # Using Python
   python -m http.server 8000
   
   # Using Node.js
   npx serve .
   
   # Using PHP
   php -S localhost:8000
   ```

3. **Open in Browser**
   Navigate to `http://localhost:8000` and allow camera permissions when prompted.

## üéÆ Usage

1. **Camera Setup** - Allow camera access when prompted
2. **Hand Position** - Hold your hands in front of the camera
3. **Effect Selection** - Use the dropdown menu to choose different visual effects
4. **Customize** - Adjust sliders for opacity, rotation, speed, and particle density
5. **Controls** - Toggle camera visibility, landmarks, and fullscreen mode
6. **Mobile** - Works on mobile devices with touch controls

### Tips for Best Results
- Ensure good lighting for optimal hand detection
- Keep hands within the camera frame
- Try different effects with various hand movements
- Adjust particle density based on your device performance
- Use fullscreen mode for immersive experience

## üõ†Ô∏è Technical Details

### Dependencies

- **Physics-Based Effects** (Flow, Waves) simulate real-world physics
- **Explosive Effects** (Fireworks, Plasma) use radial particle emission
- **Organic Effects** (Aurora, Spiral) use smooth, flowing animations

## üîß Customization

The application supports extensive customization through:
- Real-time parameter adjustment
- Effect switching without restart
- Camera overlay control
- Performance monitoring
- Debug visualization

## üìä Performance

Optimized for smooth performance across devices:
- **Desktop**: 60fps at 1080p with high particle density
- **Mobile**: 30-60fps with adaptive quality
- **Low-end devices**: Automatic quality reduction for stable performance
